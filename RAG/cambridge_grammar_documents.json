    "content": "A clause is the basic unit of grammar. Typically a main clause is made up of a subject (s) (a noun phrase) and a verb phrase (v). Sometimes the verb phrase is followed by other elements, e.g objects (o), complements (c), adjuncts (ad). These other elements are sometimes essential to complete the meaning of the clause: Not: Jo doesn’t feel. (well is essential because it completes the meaning of feel.) [S]They [V]haven’t posted [O]all the invitations. (post is a transitive verb which needs an object, all the invitations) The underlined words are not essential to complete the clause: [S]I[V]’ll call [O]you [AD]later. [S]All the girls [V]laughed [AD]loudly. When we give a command, we don’t usually use a subject: When we do use the subject, it is to reinforce the instruction or to make clear exactly who the speaker is talking to: Main (or independent) clauses can form sentences on their own. They aren’t dependent on other clauses. They are always finite (they must contain a verb which shows tense). Subordinate (or dependent) clauses cannot form sentences on their own. They are dependent on main clauses to form sentences. They can be finite or non-finite (the main clauses are in bold; the subordinate clauses are underlined): I didn’t go to work because I wasn’t feeling very well. He studied violin and mathematics before taking a medical degree and doing postgraduate work in biophysics at Harvard. She had pretty hair and must have been nice-looking when she was young. If I tell him will he be angry? We can combine clauses of the same grammatical type to form sentences using coordinating conjunctions: [main clause]I’ll take the train and [main clause]you can take the car. I’ll give you a call [subordinate clause]if I’m going to be late or [subordinate clause]if I’m not coming. You can use the phone [non-finite clause]to receive calls but [non-finite clause]not to make them. We don’t create coordinated clauses with clauses of a different grammatical type. For example we cannot coordinate a main clause and a subordinate clause: Ten minutes passed and no one had come. Not: Ten minutes passed and if no-one had come.

    "id": "cambridge_Ellipsis",
    "source": "Cambridge Grammar",
    "title": "Ellipsis",
    "content": "Ellipsis happens when we leave out (in other words, when we don’t use) items which we would normally expect to use in a sentence if we followed the grammatical rules. The following examples show ellipsis. The items left out are in brackets [ ]: I am absolutely sure [that] I have met her somewhere before. [Have you] Seen my gloves anywhere? She sang and [she] played the violin at the same time. Yes. [I’m] Ready now. [I’m] Sorry to keep you waiting. In fact, when we use ellipsis appropriately, no one thinks we have ‘left out’ anything, and ellipsis is normal and very common, especially in informal conversation. When we can easily understand everything in the sentence because of the surrounding text, we use textual ellipsis. For example, we know that certain verbs and adjectives can be followed by a that-clause, so if we see a clause without that after such verbs and adjectives, we assume that the writer or speaker wants us to understand the same meaning as a that-clause: I knew [that] something terrible had happened. Maureen was glad [that] we had called in to see her. Are you afraid [that] you won’t get a job when you leave college? The same happens when we do not repeat words in clauses connected with and, but and or (coordinated clauses). We understand what the ‘missing’ items are: We went for a walk and [we] took some lovely photographs. He wrote to [everyone he could think of who might help] and [he] phoned everyone he could think of who might help. I can remember his face but [I] can’t remember his name. Do you want to stay in or [do you want to] go out tonight? We can also leave out the complement of a verb when it is obvious what the complement is: Why don’t they move to a bigger place? They don’t want to [move to a bigger place]. They’re happy where they are. I’d better not [have more coffee]. I won’t be able to sleep later. When we do not need to mention someone or something because it is obvious from the immediate situation, we use situational ellipsis. Situational ellipsis often means we do not need to use the subject pronoun I, especially at the beginning of a clause. This is quite informal: [I] Wonder where Joe Healey is these days? Bye! [I] Hope you have a nice holiday. We can also omit a third person pronoun (he, she, it, they) at the beginning of a clause in informal conversation when it is obvious who or what we are referring to: I saw Janice in town. [She] Said she’s getting married next year. Yeah. [She] Met some guy and got engaged to him after only a couple of weeks, apparently. There’s something wrong with the car. [It] Started making a funny noise on the way home. In informal conversation, we can leave out both a subject pronoun such as I or you and an accompanying auxiliary verb at the beginning of a clause when the meaning is obvious. This is most common in questions: [Have you] Finished with the newspaper? [I’ve] Lost my car keys again. Have you seen them? In questions in informal conversation, with the second person pronoun you, we can leave out the auxiliary verb only: [Have] You finished your essay yet? [Are] You going to the match on Saturday? We can also do the same in informal conversation in questions with third person noun subjects: [Has] Claire bought a new car yet? She said she was going to. We don’t normally do this with the first person pronoun I: In questions in informal conversation, we can leave out a subject pronoun, or a subject pronoun and an accompanying auxiliary verb, when we use a question tag: [He] Gave up his job, did he? I thought he would. [You] Wrote to the local newspaper, did you? Good idea. He was asked to leave the room. Yes. [He] Didn’t like it, did he? Pat and Cathy certainly had a long break from work. Yeah. [They] Went away for a month, didn’t they? In informal conversation, we can sometimes omit articles (a/an, the) when they are obvious from the context and when we use them at the beginning of a sentence: [The] Dog wants to go out. Can you open the door for him? [A] Pen. Can you see one anywhere? [The] Postman’s just been. There’s a letter for you. We often leave out the first word of a fixed expression in informal conversation because we know the listener will understand the expression: I’d love to go with you. [The] Trouble is, I’ve got to work on Saturday this week. I can’t read that. I’m [as] blind as a bat without my glasses. Substitution is similar to ellipsis in many ways, because both enable the speaker to reduce what they are saying. Ellipsis is simply leaving something out that is usually obvious. Substitution involves using words such as do and so and not instead of a clause. She could sleep in the study on the sofa. Yes, she could [sleep in the study on the sofa]. The Chairman threatened to resign, and he finally did so in 2008. (did so = resigned) I’d better not [have another cake]. I’m supposed to be on a diet. I hope not. There’s only enough food for three.

We have to reword what we want to say by using other expressions: I’d love to be able to see the Taj Mahal one day. Not: I’d love to can see the Taj Mahal one day. Not: They musted sell their house. Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase (after the subject) and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a main verb or an auxiliary verb (be, have): Modal verbs do not change form for tense or person. Modal verbs can be followed by the substitute verb do: We thought he might sell the house Modal verbs cannot be used with another modal verb: Not: Windsurfing can might be difficult. or Windsurfing might can be difficult. Modal verbs always go before other verbs in a verb phrase: I think the bill could be expensive. Not: I think the bill could expensive. You can go swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition. Not: You can swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition. Modal verbs can only be used alone when the main verb is clearly understood: Yeah, that’s true. She could. (She could take the bus.) Yes, he may. (Yes, he may be wrong.) Negatives are formed by adding ‘not’ after the modal verbs. We don’t use don’t/doesn’t/didn’t with modal verbs: We can’t hear very well at the back. Not: We don’t can hear very well … The subject and the modal verb change position to form questions. We don’t use do/does/did: Not: Does it will be a problem? Not: Why don’t you can come too? We use modal verbs in question tags: You can’t live like that, can you? It could be any of those things, couldn’t it? In speaking shall and will are often contracted to ’ll and would is contracted to ’d, especially when they follow a pronoun: The negative forms of modal verbs are often contracted. cannot (usually written as one word not two) * is the more common of the two forms. We usually put adverbs in mid position between the modal verb and the main verb: Loud noises may sometimes frighten dogs and other animals. You’ll probably notice something different about the house. When the main verb is understood, we can put the adverb between the subject and the modal verb: I can never remember Flo’s number. I never can either. (I can never remember Flo’s number either.) Dare, need, ought to and used to are often called semi-modal because in some ways they are formed like modal verbs and in some ways they are like other main verbs. Like modal verbs, ought to and used to do not change form for person. Needn’t and daren’t do not have a third person -s in the present: It used to be so easy. It ought to be easy now. John daren’t tell Ruth about the accident. Like main verbs, the negative form of need, dare and used to is made by using do. But it can also be made without using do (like modal verbs). You don’t need to dress smartly. The negative form of ought to is not made with do: We oughtn’t to spend so much money. Not: We don’t ought to spend so much money. Like main verbs, the question form for need, dare and used to is made by using do: Does she need to get a camera before she goes away? Did you use to play football when you were a child?

A speaker or writer can express certainty, possibility, willingness, obligation, necessity and ability by using modal words and expressions.

Here are the main verbs we use to express modal meanings: Core modal verbs: can, could, may, might, will, shall, would, should, must Semi-modals: dare, need, ought to, used to Other verbs with modal meanings: have (got) to, be going to and be able to There are a number of other words and expressions in English, apart from the main modal verbs, which also express modal meanings.

Negation can happen in a number of ways, most commonly, when we use a negative word such as no, not, never, none, nobody, etc: No. The last one goes at nine forty-five. (No = There isn’t a bus at ten o’clock.) Kieran doesn’t play the piano. (It is not true that Kieran plays the piano.) The most common negative words are no and not. Other negative words include: neither, never, no one, nobody, none, nor, nothing, nowhere: There were no newspapers left in the shop by one o’clock. Nobody came to the house for several days. None of my cousins live near us. Most children don’t walk to school any more. Neither, neither … nor and not … either No one, nobody, nothing, nowhere We can also make negative meanings using prefixes (e.g. de-, dis-, un-) and suffixes (-less): He was very disrespectful to the teacher. This new printer is useless; it’s always breaking down. We can also use the following words to make negative or negative-like statements: few, hardly, little, rarely, scarcely, seldom. There are rarely ducks in this pond. We seldom hear any noise at night. Hardly ever, rarely, scarcely, seldom Negation is more common in spoken than in written language because negative forms can be used in face-to-face interactions to make what we say less direct: I’m not sure if this is the right desk. I’m looking for information on the train times to Liverpool. (less direct than Is this the right desk?) We form negative statements with not or n’t after be, modal and auxiliary verbs. n’t is the contracted form of not. In informal language we can add n’t, without a space, to be, to modal verbs (except may) and to auxiliary verbs (do and have). The negative contracted form of will is won’t. The uncontracted form of can + not is cannot. Jan isn’t coming. She’s not feeling very well. She might not be joking. It could be true. They don’t go to school on Wednesday afternoons. Living in a small flat does not make it easy to have pets. I hadn’t decided whether to take the train or go in the car. They can’t be hungry again. They’ve only just eaten. We use not or n’t to form negative questions. When there is no modal verb or be, we use auxiliary verb do + n’t (don’t, do not, doesn’t, does not, didn’t): We use do + not or don’t + the base form of a verb to form negative orders or commands: Don’t take the car. Go on your bike. Not and n’t in questions (Did you not …? Wasn’t she …?) Don’t, Do not: orders and instructions Let’s, let: suggestions, offers, imperatives Standard English does not have two negatives in the same clause (double negatives). Words such as never, nobody, no one, none, nothing, nowhere, etc. already have a negative meaning, so we don’t need another negative with the verb: There was no one in the office so I left a message. Nobody likes to think they are worthless. Not: Nobody doesn’t like to think … If we use not with the verb, we use words such as ever, anybody, anyone, anything, anywhere, instead of never, nobody, no one, nothing, nowhere: I haven’t seen Ken anywhere today. In fact I don’t think anyone’s seen him for the last couple of days. Not: I haven’t seen Ken nowhere … or I don’t think no one’s seen him … You may hear some speakers using two negatives in the same clause, but many people consider this to be incorrect. There are some cases where we can use reporting verbs such as imagine, suppose and think in end position, after the reported clause. In such cases, both clauses may have a negative verb: He’s not a teacher, I don’t think. (or I don’t think he’s a teacher.) Not: I don’t think he’s not a teacher. I won’t be very late tonight, I shouldn’t imagine. (or I shouldn’t imagine I’ll be very late tonight.) Not: I shouldn’t imagine I won’t be late. Sometimes we use not in front position where a following reduced clause (a clause with something omitted but which is understood) also has a negative form: Not today, I haven’t. (I haven’t seen Leila/her.) Is Tony working at the university? We don’t use not with some, someone, somebody, something, somewhere in statements. We use any, anyone, anybody, anything, anywhere: There aren’t any seats left. You’ll have to stand. Not: There aren’t some seats left. Tell them I don’t want to see anyone. Not: Tell them I don’t want to see someone. After verbs with a negative meaning like decline or refuse, we use anything rather than something: They refused to tell us anything about it. (preferred to They refused to tell us something about it.) Non-finite clauses are clauses without a subject, where the main verb is in the to-infinitive form, the -ing form or the -ed form. To make the negative of a non-finite clause, we can use not. To have given up such a good job would have been foolish. Not to have invited James to our little party would have been impolite. Thinking of my own situation, I decided it was time to talk to Dennis. She left the house very quietly, not wishing to alarm anyone. Cooked in a slow oven, this dish is delicious with baked potatoes. Not funded by any government grants, the research team have to raise money from companies and individuals. In non-finite clauses with a to-infinitive verb, we can use not after to. However, many speakers consider such ‘split infinitives’ (where something comes between to and the verb) to be bad style: To not realise what was happening was stupid. She should have noticed something was wrong. (or Not to realise what was happening …) I was thinking it would be nice to not have to go out and just stay in and watch TV. (or … it would be nice not to have to go out …) We use these prefixes most commonly in negation: de-, dis-, il-/im-/in-/ir-, mis-, non-, un-: What he said was very impolite. There was a misunderstanding about who should sign the contract. The refugees also need non-food items such as tents and blankets. (items which are not food) -less is the most common suffix for negation: Too many people are homeless in this city. We just have endless meetings at work – they’re so boring. Some adverbs (e.g. hardly, little, never, only, scarcely and seldom) have a negative meaning. When we use these at the beginning of the clause, we invert the subject and verb: Hardly had we left the hotel when it started to pour with rain. Not: Hardly we had left the hotel … Little did we know that we would never meet again. Only in spring do we see these lovely little flowers. We also invert the subject and verb after not + a prepositional phrase or not + a clause in front position: Not for a moment did I think I would be offered the job, so I was amazed when I got it. Not till I got home did I realise my wallet was missing. Hardly ever, rarely, scarcely, seldom When we want to emphasise something negative, we often use at all. We normally use at all immediately after the word or phrase we are emphasising: There’s nothing at all left in the fridge. We had no rain at all this summer and now we have floods! Not at all can come before an adjective: She was not at all happy with the result. We can also use whatsoever for emphasis after no + noun, nobody, no one, none and nothing. Its meaning is similar to at all, but it is stronger. We can use whatsoever to add emphasis to any negative noun phrase: No food or drink whatsoever must be brought into the classroom. Did any of her family go to the wedding? We can also use not a bit, a little bit, one bit, in the least, the least bit to emphasise negatives: Setting off the alarm was supposed to be a joke but no one found it one bit funny. We suggested going to the cinema but they didn’t seem the least bit interested, so we just took them shopping instead. We often add emphasis to negation to make what we say more polite. When someone makes a request using the phrase Do you mind if or Would you mind if, instead of replying with No (I don’t mind) we often say not at all or not in the least when we reply: Would you mind if I check my emails on your computer? When someone says thanks or thank you, we often reply not at all: Thanks so much for lunch, Rachel. Not at all. It was my pleasure. When we use verbs like think, believe, suppose (mental process verbs) to express uncertainty about something, we usually use not with the mental process verb rather than with the verb in the following clause: I don’t think I’m going to pass my exams. (preferred to I think I’m not going to pass my exams.) However, we don’t normally use a negative with hope and wish: Not: I don’t hope I’m going to fail. I wish I hadn’t sent that email to Joan. So and not with expect, hope, think, etc. to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!

    "title": "Neither, neither … nor and not … either",
    "content": "Neither allows us to make a negative statement about two people or things at the same time. Neither goes before singular countable nouns. We use it to say ‘not either’ in relation to two things. Neither can be pronounced /ˈnaɪðə(r)/ or /ˈni:ðə(r)/. Neither parent came to meet the teacher. (The mother didn’t come and the father didn’t come.) Neither dress fitted her. (There were two dresses and not one of them fitted her.) We use neither of before pronouns and plural countable nouns which have a determiner (my, his, the) before them: Neither of us went to the concert. Neither of the birthday cards was suitable. In formal styles, we use neither of with a singular verb when it is the subject. However, in informal speaking, people often use plural verbs: Neither of my best friends was around. Neither of them were interested in going to university. In speaking, we can use neither on its own in replies when we are referring to two things that have already been mentioned: Mike, which would you prefer, tea or coffee? Neither thanks. I’ve just had a coffee. We can use neither as a conjunction with nor. It connects two or more negative alternatives. This can sound formal in speaking: Neither Brian nor his wife mentioned anything about moving house. (Brian didn’t mention that they were moving house and his wife didn’t mention that they were moving house.) Neither Italy nor France got to the quarter finals last year. The less formal alternative is to use and … not … either: Italy didn’t get to the quarter finals last year and France didn’t either. When a clause with neither or nor is used after a negative clause, we invert the subject and the verb after neither and nor: He hadn’t done any homework, neither had he brought any of his books to class. We didn’t get to see the castle, nor did we see the cathedral. We use neither and nor + auxiliary/modal verb + subject to mean ‘also not’: I hate snakes. I can’t even look at a picture of a snake. We can use not … either to mean ‘also not’, but we do not change the word order of the auxiliary or modal verb and subject: I haven’t either. (or Neither have I./Nor have I.) I didn’t see Lesley at the concert. I didn’t either. (or Neither did I./Nor did I.) In informal speaking, we often say me neither: Me neither. (or I can’t either.) We use neither, not none, when we are talking about two people or things: Books and television are different. Neither of them should replace the other. We don’t normally use both (of) + not to make a negative statement about two people or things: Neither of these shirts is/are dry yet. Not: Both of these shirts aren’t dry yet. Take care to spell neither correctly: not ‘niether’ or ‘neighter’. to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!

Most nouns are common nouns, referring to classes or categories of people, animals and things. Proper nouns are the names of specific people, animals and things. They are written with a capital letter at the start. Concrete nouns refer to material objects which we can see or touch. Abstract nouns refer to things which are not material objects, such as ideas, feelings and situations. Nouns: countable and uncountable It is not always possible to identify a noun by its form.

We use singular verbs with singular nouns, and plural verbs with plural nouns: My house is the white house on the corner. Those houses were all built in the 1950s. The rules for making the plural of nouns depend on the spelling and pronunciation. Most nouns form their plural by adding -s: In other cases, the plural depends on how the noun ends. If the noun ends in -ch, -s, -sh, -x or -z, add -es. The plural ending -es. is pronounced /ɪz/ (/ˈbɒksɪz/, /ˈwɒtʃɪz/). If the noun ends in a consonant plus -y, change y to i and add -es. For some nouns ending in -f, change -f to -ves but note: roof-roofs, belief-beliefs, cliff-cliffs. If the noun ends in -o, add -es but note: radio-radios, video-videos.

    "content": "Tenses refer to different forms of a verb or verb phrase. We use different tenses to talk or write about different times. For example, we usually use present tense verb forms to talk about states, events or actions that happen or are happening in the present time. We usually use past tense verb forms to talk about past time, to describe events, states or actions that have finished. We can also use past tense forms to refer to present time, for example, for reasons of politeness or indirectness (I was wondering if you wanted a drink) and present tense forms to refer to past time, for example, for dramatic effect. There is no future tense form of verbs in English. We refer to future time in several different ways for different functions, for example, using the present tense or be going to or will.

    "title": "Phrasal verbs and multi-word verbs",
    "content": "Multi-word verbs are verbs which consist of a verb and one or two particles or prepositions (e.g. up, over, in, down). There are three types of multi-word verbs: phrasal verbs, prepositional verbs and phrasal-prepositional verbs. Sometimes, the name ‘phrasal verb’ is used to refer to all three types. Phrasal verbs have two parts: a main verb and an adverb particle. The most common adverb particles used to form phrasal verbs are around, at, away, down, in, off, on, out, over, round, up: bring in go around look up put away take off Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. (The meanings are in brackets.) The book first came out in 1997. (was published) The plane took off an hour late. (flew into the air) The lecture went on till 6.30. (continued) It’s difficult to make out what she’s saying. (hear/understand) For a complete list of the most common phrasal verbs, see the Cambridge International Dictionary of Phrasal Verbs. Phrasal verbs are often, but not always, less formal than a single word with the same meaning. We need to sort the problem out. We need to solve/resolve the problem. The team only had an hour to put the stage up before the concert. The team only had an hour to erect/construct the stage before the concert. Many phrasal verbs take an object. In most cases, the particle may come before or after the object if the object is not a personal pronoun (me, you, him, us, etc.). (p = particle; o = object [underlined]) She brought [P]up [O]three kids all alone. I brought [O]my children [P]up to be polite. Do you want me to take [P]off [O]my shoes? Come in. Take [O]your coat [P]off. If the object is a personal pronoun (me, you, him, us, etc.), we always put the pronoun before the particle: I’ve made some copies. Would you like me to hand them out? Not: Would you like me to hand out them? Oh, I can’t lift you up any more. You’re too big now! Not: I can’t lift up you any more. We usually put longer objects (underlined) after the particle: Many couples do not want to take on the responsibility of bringing up a large family of three or four children. We can use some phrasal verbs without an object: The taxi broke down on the way to the airport and I thought I nearly missed my flight. We’d better set off before the rush-hour traffic starts. What time did you wake up this morning? A good learner’s dictionary will tell you if the phrasal verb needs an object or can be used without one. Prepositional verbs have two parts: a verb and a preposition which cannot be separated from each other: cope with (a difficult situation) Prepositional verbs always have an object, which comes immediately after the preposition. The object (underlined) can be a noun phrase, a pronoun or the -ing form of a verb: Somebody broke into his car and stole his radio. I don’t like this CD. I don’t want to listen to it any more. Getting to the final depends on winning the semi-final! Some prepositional verbs take a direct object after the verb followed by the prepositional phrase. (do = direct object; po = object of preposition [both underlined]) Hannah reminds [DO]me of [PO]a girlfriend of mine. How can we protect [DO]children from [PO]dangerous material on the Internet? I’d like to thank [DO]everyone for [PO]their kindness. Not all phrasal verbs need an object. Prepositional verbs (e.g. listen to, depend on) always have an object after the preposition: I’ve got a great new CD. Shall we listen to it? With phrasal verbs the object can come before or after the particle if the object is not a pronoun. With prepositional verbs, the object is always immediately after the preposition.(Objects are underlined.) Do you always look up every new word in a dictionary? Do you always look every new word up in a dictionary? Phrasal verb: the object can come before or after the particle up. Could you look after my bag while I go and buy the tickets? Prepositional verb: the object is after the preposition. Not: Could you look my bag after … Phrasal-prepositional verbs have three parts: a verb, a particle and a preposition. The particle and the preposition cannot be separated. Many of these verbs are often used in informal contexts, and their meaning is difficult to guess from their individual parts. Ken’s just chatting to a friend. He’ll catch up with us in a minute. (reach, join) Do you get on with your neighbours? (have a good relationship with) We look forward to meeting you on the 22nd. (anticipate with pleasure) The object (underlined below) always comes immediately after the preposition, and not in any other position: She was a wonderful teacher. We all looked up to her. (respected) Not: We all looked her up to. or We all looked up her to. Some phrasal-prepositional verbs also take a direct object after the verb as well as an object of the preposition: (do = direct object; po = object of preposition [both underlined]) She fixed [DO]us up with [PO]a violin teacher. We’re really grateful to her. (fixed us up with = arranged for us) We just put [DO]the accident down to [PO]bad luck; there’s no other reason. (put down to = think the cause or reason is) to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!

Typical question clauses are called interrogatives and the normal word order is auxiliary/modal verb (aux/mod) + subject (s) + main verb (v) + x, where x is any other element present (e.g. object/predicative complement): [AUX][S]Do you [V]like [X]my new hairstyle? [MOD]Must [S]you [V]make [X]that noise? Questions can be affirmative or negative: Are you ready yet? Aren’t you ready yet? Why did you leave? Why didn’t you leave? In speaking, questions usually have a particular type of intonation that tells the listener that they are questions. Questions: statement questions (you’re over 18?) In speaking and writing, we sometimes ask questions which do not require a spoken or written response, but they usually require a mental response. The listener or reader thinks about the answer but does not say or write it; the speaker or writer answers the question in their mind. We often use these questions in academic lectures and texts: Knowing taxation laws is important. Why is that? These laws help us … Why was Freud so influential? This is an interesting question which this essay will explore in detail. Questions: echo and checking questions to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!

    "content": "Intonation describes how the voice rises and falls in speech. The three main patterns of intonation in English are: falling intonation, rising intonation and fall-rise intonation. Falling intonation describes how the voice falls on the final stressed syllable of a phrase or a group of words. A falling intonation is very common in wh-questions. Where’s the nearest p↘ost-office? What time does the film f↘inish? We also use falling intonation when we say something definite, or when we want to be very clear about something: I think we are completely l↘ost. OK, here’s the magaz↘ine you wanted. Rising intonation describes how the voice rises at the end of a sentence. Rising intonation is common in yes-no questions: I hear the Health Centre is expanding. So, is that the new d↗octor? Fall-rise intonation describes how the voice falls and then rises. We use fall-rise intonation at the end of statements when we want to say that we are not sure, or when we may have more to add: I do↘n’t support any football team at the m↘om↗ent. (but I may change my mind in future). It rained every day in the firs↘t w↗eek. (but things improved after that). We use fall-rise intonation with questions, especially when we request information or invite somebody to do or to have something. The intonation pattern makes the questions sound more polite: Would you like another co↘ff↗ee? to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!

There are two types of relative clause: one type refers to a noun or noun phrase (these are defining and non-defining relative clauses) and the other type refers to a whole sentence or clause, especially in speaking.

Paddington is a train station in London.] So it leaves Paddington at 8.30 and it’ll get me into Gloucester at 10.15. Which is perfect because I can pick you up on my way home. (Speaker B is evaluating the fact that the train gets into Gloucester at 10.15.) Sometimes the same speaker may add a which-clause after a response by a listener: I was already working with them doing a temporary job and I was asked if I would go on a permanent contract. Which I did. (Speaker A was offered a permanent job contract and accepted the offer.)

    "content": "Reported speech is how we represent the speech of other people or what we ourselves say. There are two main types of reported speech: direct speech and indirect speech. Direct speech repeats the exact words the person used, or how we remember their words: Barbara said, “I didn’t realise it was midnight.” In indirect speech, the original speaker’s words are changed. Barbara said she hadn’t realised it was midnight. In this example, I becomes she and the verb tense reflects the fact that time has passed since the words were spoken: didn’t realise becomes hadn’t realised. Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words: “I’m sorry,” said Mark. (direct) Mark apologised. (indirect: report of a speech act) In a similar way, we can report what people wrote or thought: ‘I will love you forever,’ he wrote, and then posted the note through Alice’s door. (direct report of what someone wrote) He wrote that he would love her forever, and then posted the note through Alice’s door. (indirect report of what someone wrote) I need a new direction in life, she thought. (direct report of someone’s thoughts) She thought that she needed a new direction in life. (indirect report of someone’s thoughts) Reported speech: indirect speech Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. The reporting clause includes a verb such as say, tell, ask, reply, shout, usually in the past simple, and the reported clause includes what the original speaker said. she’s thinking of moving to Canada. In direct speech we usually put a comma between the reporting clause and the reported clause. The words of the original speaker are enclosed in inverted commas, either single (‘…’) or double (“…”). If the reported clause comes first, we put the comma inside the inverted commas: “I couldn’t sleep last night,” he said. Rita said, ‘I don’t need you any more.’ If the direct speech is a question or exclamation, we use a question mark or exclamation mark, not a comma: ‘Is there a reason for this?’ she asked. We sometimes use a colon (:) between the reporting clause and the reported clause when the reporting clause is first: The officer replied: ‘It is not possible to see the General. He’s busy.’ In indirect speech it is more common for the reporting clause to come first. When the reporting clause is first, we don’t put a comma between the reporting clause and the reported clause. When the reporting clause comes after the reported clause, we use a comma to separate the two parts: She told me they had left her without any money. Not: She told me, they had left her without any money. Nobody had gone in or out during the previous hour, he informed us. We don’t use question marks or exclamation marks in indirect reports of questions and exclamations: He asked me why I was so upset. Not: He asked me why I was so upset? We can use say and tell to report statements in direct speech, but say is more common. We don’t always mention the person being spoken to with say, but if we do mention them, we use a prepositional phrase with to (to me, to Lorna): ‘I’ll give you a ring tomorrow,’ she said. ‘Try to stay calm,’ she said to us in a low voice. Not: ‘Try to stay calm,’ she said us in a low voice. With tell, we always mention the person being spoken to; we use an indirect object (underlined): ‘Enjoy yourselves,’ he told them. Not: ‘Enjoy yourselves,’ he told. In indirect speech, say and tell are both common as reporting verbs. We don’t use an indirect object with say, but we always use an indirect object (underlined) with tell: He said he was moving to New Zealand. Not: He said me he was moving to New Zealand. He told me he was moving to New Zealand. Not: He told he was moving to New Zealand. We use say, but not tell, to report questions: Not: ‘Are you going now?’ she told me. We use say, not tell, to report greetings, congratulations and other wishes: Not: Happy birthday!’ she told me. Everyone said good luck to me as I went into the interview. Not: Everyone told me good luck … The reporting verbs in this list are more common in indirect reports, in both speaking and writing: Simon admitted that he had forgotten to email Andrea. Louis always maintains that there is royal blood in his family. The builder pointed out that the roof was in very poor condition. Most of the verbs in the list are used in direct speech reports in written texts such as novels and newspaper reports. In ordinary conversation, we don’t use them in direct speech. The reporting clause usually comes second, but can sometimes come first: ‘Who is that person?’ she asked. ‘It was my fault,’ he confessed. ‘There is no cause for alarm,’ the Minister insisted.

    "title": "Reported speech: direct speech",
    "content": "Direct speech is a representation of the actual words someone said. A direct speech report usually has a reporting verb in the past simple. The most common reporting verb is said. The reporting clause may come first or second. The reporting clause may sometimes come in the middle of the reported clause, especially in literary styles: “No,” she said, “I’ve never seen it before.” ‘Was it,’ he asked, ‘the first time you had spoken to Mrs Dalton?’ We can use adverbs with the reporting verb to describe the way someone said something. This is more common when the reporting clause comes second: “I will not accept it!” he said angrily. ‘Can I speak to the doctor?’ she asked rather nervously. Reported speech: reporting and reported clauses In narratives, especially novels and short stories, when the reporting clause comes second, we often invert the subject (s) and reporting verb (v): “Things have always been the same in this village,” [V]said [S]the old man. ‘Hold on! I’m coming!’ [V]cried [S]Maurice. In informal conversation, we sometimes use the present simple in the reporting clause. This makes the direct speech more vivid and dramatic: So then this guy says, “I’ve got something for you. Come over here.” And he picked up a box and he says, “Open that.” We can make the direct speech even more vivid and dramatic by using the present continuous. This is very informal: And he’s looking at me and he’s asking, “Who are you?” and I said, “I’m your nephew” and he’s mumbling, “I don’t know you. I’ve never seen you before in my life.” In very informal conversation, people sometimes use says as a reporting verb for all persons (I, you, she, he, we, they): She says, ‘What’s going on here?’ and I says, ‘Nothing. There’s nothing happening – everything’s okay.’ Many speakers consider the above examples to be incorrect. This applies especially to the use of says with all persons. We also use the present simple in newspaper headlines. This makes the reported words more dramatic: ‘I WON’T RESIGN,’ SAYS MINISTER to stop doing or being involved with something Stop whining!
