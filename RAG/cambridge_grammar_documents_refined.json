    "title": "Ellipsis",
    "content": "Ellipsis happens when we leave out (in other words, when we don’t use) items which we would normally expect to use in a sentence if we followed the grammatical rules. The following examples show ellipsis. The items left out are in brackets [ ]: I am absolutely sure [that] I have met her somewhere before. She sang and [she] played the violin at the same time. Yes. [I’m] Ready now. [I’m] Sorry to keep you waiting. In fact, when we use ellipsis appropriately, no one thinks we have ‘left out’ anything, and ellipsis is normal and very common, especially in informal conversation. When we can easily understand everything in the sentence because of the surrounding text, we use textual ellipsis. For example, we know that certain verbs and adjectives can be followed by a that-clause, so if we see a clause without that after such verbs and adjectives, we assume that the writer or speaker wants us to understand the same meaning as a that-clause: Maureen was glad [that] we had called in to see her. Are you afraid [that] you won’t get a job when you leave college? The same happens when we do not repeat words in clauses connected with and, but and or (coordinated clauses). We understand what the ‘missing’ items are: We went for a walk and [we] took some lovely photographs. He wrote to [everyone he could think of who might help] and [he] phoned everyone he could think of who might help. I can remember his face but [I] can’t remember his name. Do you want to stay in or [do you want to] go out tonight? We can also leave out the complement of a verb when it is obvious what the complement is: They don’t want to [move to a bigger place]. They’re happy where they are. I’d better not [have more coffee]. I won’t be able to sleep later. When we do not need to mention someone or something because it is obvious from the immediate situation, we use situational ellipsis. Situational ellipsis often means we do not need to use the subject pronoun I, especially at the beginning of a clause. This is quite informal: We can also omit a third person pronoun (he, she, it, they) at the beginning of a clause in informal conversation when it is obvious who or what we are referring to: I saw Janice in town. [She] Said she’s getting married next year. Yeah. [She] Met some guy and got engaged to him after only a couple of weeks, apparently. There’s something wrong with the car. [It] Started making a funny noise on the way home. In informal conversation, we can leave out both a subject pronoun such as I or you and an accompanying auxiliary verb at the beginning of a clause when the meaning is obvious. This is most common in questions: In questions in informal conversation, with the second person pronoun you, we can leave out the auxiliary verb only: We can also do the same in informal conversation in questions with third person noun subjects: [Has] Claire bought a new car yet? She said she was going to. We don’t normally do this with the first person pronoun I: In questions in informal conversation, we can leave out a subject pronoun, or a subject pronoun and an accompanying auxiliary verb, when we use a question tag: [You] Wrote to the local newspaper, did you? Good idea. Pat and Cathy certainly had a long break from work. In informal conversation, we can sometimes omit articles (a/an, the) when they are obvious from the context and when we use them at the beginning of a sentence: [The] Dog wants to go out. Can you open the door for him? [The] Postman’s just been. There’s a letter for you. We often leave out the first word of a fixed expression in informal conversation because we know the listener will understand the expression: I’d love to go with you. [The] Trouble is, I’ve got to work on Saturday this week. I can’t read that. I’m [as] blind as a bat without my glasses. Substitution is similar to ellipsis in many ways, because both enable the speaker to reduce what they are saying. Ellipsis is simply leaving something out that is usually obvious. Substitution involves using words such as do and so and not instead of a clause. The Chairman threatened to resign, and he finally did so in 2008. (did so = resigned) I’d better not [have another cake]. I’m supposed to be on a diet. I hope not. There’s only enough food for three.

    "title": "Modality: forms",
    "content": "Core modal verbs have only one form. They have no to-infinitive form, -ing form, past form or -ed form. We have to reword what we want to say by using other expressions: Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase (after the subject) and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a main verb or an auxiliary verb (be, have): Modal verbs do not change form for tense or person. Modal verbs can be followed by the substitute verb do: Modal verbs cannot be used with another modal verb: Not: Windsurfing can might be difficult. or Windsurfing might can be difficult. Modal verbs always go before other verbs in a verb phrase: You can go swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition. Not: You can swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition. Modal verbs can only be used alone when the main verb is clearly understood: Yeah, that’s true. She could. (She could take the bus.) Negatives are formed by adding ‘not’ after the modal verbs. We don’t use don’t/doesn’t/didn’t with modal verbs: The subject and the modal verb change position to form questions. We don’t use do/does/did: In speaking shall and will are often contracted to ’ll and would is contracted to ’d, especially when they follow a pronoun: The negative forms of modal verbs are often contracted. We usually put adverbs in mid position between the modal verb and the main verb: Loud noises may sometimes frighten dogs and other animals. You’ll probably notice something different about the house. When the main verb is understood, we can put the adverb between the subject and the modal verb: I never can either. (I can never remember Flo’s number either.) Dare, need, ought to and used to are often called semi-modal because in some ways they are formed like modal verbs and in some ways they are like other main verbs. Like modal verbs, ought to and used to do not change form for person. Needn’t and daren’t do not have a third person -s in the present: Like main verbs, the negative form of need, dare and used to is made by using do. But it can also be made without using do (like modal verbs). Like main verbs, the question form for need, dare and used to is made by using do: Does she need to get a camera before she goes away?

    "title": "Phrasal verbs and multi-word verbs",
    "content": "Multi-word verbs are verbs which consist of a verb and one or two particles or prepositions (e.g. up, over, in, down). There are three types of multi-word verbs: phrasal verbs, prepositional verbs and phrasal-prepositional verbs. Sometimes, the name ‘phrasal verb’ is used to refer to all three types. Phrasal verbs have two parts: a main verb and an adverb particle. The most common adverb particles used to form phrasal verbs are around, at, away, down, in, off, on, out, over, round, up: Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. (The meanings are in brackets.) The plane took off an hour late. (flew into the air) It’s difficult to make out what she’s saying. (hear/understand) For a complete list of the most common phrasal verbs, see the Cambridge International Dictionary of Phrasal Verbs. Phrasal verbs are often, but not always, less formal than a single word with the same meaning. The team only had an hour to put the stage up before the concert. The team only had an hour to erect/construct the stage before the concert. Many phrasal verbs take an object. In most cases, the particle may come before or after the object if the object is not a personal pronoun (me, you, him, us, etc.). If the object is a personal pronoun (me, you, him, us, etc.), we always put the pronoun before the particle: I’ve made some copies. Would you like me to hand them out? Oh, I can’t lift you up any more. You’re too big now! We usually put longer objects (underlined) after the particle: Many couples do not want to take on the responsibility of bringing up a large family of three or four children. The taxi broke down on the way to the airport and I thought I nearly missed my flight. We’d better set off before the rush-hour traffic starts. A good learner’s dictionary will tell you if the phrasal verb needs an object or can be used without one. Prepositional verbs have two parts: a verb and a preposition which cannot be separated from each other: Prepositional verbs always have an object, which comes immediately after the preposition. The object (underlined) can be a noun phrase, a pronoun or the -ing form of a verb: I don’t like this CD. I don’t want to listen to it any more. Getting to the final depends on winning the semi-final! Some prepositional verbs take a direct object after the verb followed by the prepositional phrase. (do = direct object; po = object of preposition [both underlined]) How can we protect [DO]children from [PO]dangerous material on the Internet? I’d like to thank [DO]everyone for [PO]their kindness. Not all phrasal verbs need an object. Prepositional verbs (e.g. listen to, depend on) always have an object after the preposition: With phrasal verbs the object can come before or after the particle if the object is not a pronoun. With prepositional verbs, the object is always immediately after the preposition.(Objects are underlined.) Do you always look up every new word in a dictionary? Do you always look every new word up in a dictionary? Phrasal verb: the object can come before or after the particle up. Could you look after my bag while I go and buy the tickets? Prepositional verb: the object is after the preposition. Phrasal-prepositional verbs have three parts: a verb, a particle and a preposition. The particle and the preposition cannot be separated. Many of these verbs are often used in informal contexts, and their meaning is difficult to guess from their individual parts. Ken’s just chatting to a friend. He’ll catch up with us in a minute. (reach, join) Do you get on with your neighbours? (have a good relationship with) We look forward to meeting you on the 22nd. (anticipate with pleasure) The object (underlined below) always comes immediately after the preposition, and not in any other position: She was a wonderful teacher. We all looked up to her. (respected) Not: We all looked her up to. or We all looked up her to. Some phrasal-prepositional verbs also take a direct object after the verb as well as an object of the preposition: (do = direct object; po = object of preposition [both underlined]) She fixed [DO]us up with [PO]a violin teacher. We’re really grateful to her. (fixed us up with = arranged for us) We just put [DO]the accident down to [PO]bad luck; there’s no other reason.

Typical question clauses are called interrogatives and the normal word order is auxiliary/modal verb (aux/mod) + subject (s) + main verb (v) + x, where x is any other element present (e.g. object/predicative complement): In speaking, questions usually have a particular type of intonation that tells the listener that they are questions. In speaking and writing, we sometimes ask questions which do not require a spoken or written response, but they usually require a mental response. The listener or reader thinks about the answer but does not say or write it; the speaker or writer answers the question in their mind. We often use these questions in academic lectures and texts: Knowing taxation laws is important. Why is that? These laws help us … Why was Freud so influential?

    "source": "Cambridge Grammar",
    "title": "Nouns: countable and uncountable",
    "content": "Some nouns refer to things which, in English, are treated as separate items which can be counted. These are called countable nouns. Here are some examples: Countable nouns can be singular or plural. They can be used with a/an and with numbers and many other determiners (e.g. these, a few): Most people buy things like cameras and MP3-players online these days. In English grammar, some things are seen as a whole or mass. These are called uncountable nouns, because they cannot be separated or counted. Ideas and experiences: advice, information, progress, news, luck, fun, work Materials and substances: water, rice, cement, gold, milk Weather words: weather, thunder, lightning, rain, snow Names for groups or collections of things: furniture, equipment, rubbish, luggage Other common uncountable nouns include: accommodation, baggage, homework, knowledge, money, permission, research, traffic, travel. These nouns are not used with a/an or numbers and are not used in the plural. We’re going to get new furniture for the living room. Not: We’re going to get a new furniture for the living room. or We’re going to get new furnitures for the living room. Some nouns always have plural form but they are uncountable because we cannot use numbers with them. Other nouns of this type are: shorts, pants, pyjamas, glasses (for the eyes), binoculars, scissors. Some nouns which are uncountable in English are countable in other languages (e.g. accommodation, advice, furniture, information): They can give you some information about accommodation at the tourist office. Not: They can give you some informations about accommodations at the tourist office. Can you give me some advice about buying a second-hand car? Not: Can you give me some advices about buying a second-hand car? A good learner’s dictionary will tell you whether a noun is countable or uncountable. To refer to one or more quantities of an uncountable noun, expressions such as a bit of, a piece of, an item of or words for containers and measures must be used: He bought a very expensive piece of furniture for his new apartment. Maggie always has some exciting bits of news when she comes to see us. I think we’ll need five bags of cement for the patio. There’s a litre of milk in the fridge for you. And I bought you a bar of chocolate. Uncountable nouns can be used with certain determiners (e.g. my, her, some, any, no, the, this, that) and expressions of quantity (e.g. a lot of, (a) little): They gave me some information about courses and scholarships and things. She’s been studying hard and has made a lot of progress. There’s no work to do here, so you can go home if you like. We can sometimes use countable noun phrases to talk about an individual example of the thing an uncountable noun refers to. Finding a place to live is difficult if you’re a student and you’ve got no money. (or Finding accommodation …) She brought two big suitcases and a rucksack with her. I read a poem once about someone riding a horse at night. We went on a trip to the Amazon when we were in Brazil. Some nouns can be used either countably or uncountably, but with different meanings. People believed that ships made of iron would sink. ‘Hamlet’ is one of Shakespeare’s most famous works. Sometimes uncountable nouns are used countably, to mean ‘a measure of something’ or ‘a type or example of something’: Can I have two teas and one coffee, please? (two cups of tea and one cup of coffee …?) How many sugars do you want in your tea? (How many spoonfuls/lumps of sugar?) To some degree we tend to eat the foods that we ate as children. (i.e. types of food) Some abstract nouns can be used uncountably or countably. The uncountable use has a more general meaning. The countable use has a more particular meaning. Nouns of this type include: education, experience, hatred, help, knowledge, life, love, sleep, time, understanding. Good education is the best investment in Britain’s future. The first daughter had a very expensive education at a private school in France. I’ve always had a love of poetry, ever since I was a child. They have a quiz every week, with questions about general knowledge. The job requires a knowledge of statistics and basic computing. Time passes more and more quickly as you grow older.

    "title": "Clauses",
    "content": "A clause is the basic unit of grammar. Typically a main clause is made up of a subject (s) (a noun phrase) and a verb phrase (v). Sometimes the verb phrase is followed by other elements, e.g objects (o), complements (c), adjuncts (ad). These other elements are sometimes essential to complete the meaning of the clause: Not: Jo doesn’t feel. (well is essential because it completes the meaning of feel.) [S]They [V]haven’t posted [O]all the invitations. (post is a transitive verb which needs an object, all the invitations) The underlined words are not essential to complete the clause: When we give a command, we don’t usually use a subject: When we do use the subject, it is to reinforce the instruction or to make clear exactly who the speaker is talking to: Main (or independent) clauses can form sentences on their own. They aren’t dependent on other clauses. They are always finite (they must contain a verb which shows tense). Subordinate (or dependent) clauses cannot form sentences on their own. They are dependent on main clauses to form sentences. They can be finite or non-finite (the main clauses are in bold; the subordinate clauses are underlined): I didn’t go to work because I wasn’t feeling very well. He studied violin and mathematics before taking a medical degree and doing postgraduate work in biophysics at Harvard. She had pretty hair and must have been nice-looking when she was young. We can combine clauses of the same grammatical type to form sentences using coordinating conjunctions: [main clause]I’ll take the train and [main clause]you can take the car. I’ll give you a call [subordinate clause]if I’m going to be late or [subordinate clause]if I’m not coming. You can use the phone [non-finite clause]to receive calls but [non-finite clause]not to make them. We don’t create coordinated clauses with clauses of a different grammatical type. For example we cannot coordinate a main clause and a subordinate clause: Main (independent) clauses and subordinate (dependent) clauses made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "title": "Substitution",
    "content": "In speaking and in writing, we try to avoid repeating words, phrases or clauses. We use substitute forms to do this: Pam always brings us back chocolates when she travels. She brought some Belgian ones from her last trip, which were delicious. Do you think I should phone Barry and ask him to come and look at it. Yes, do. (B uses do to avoid repeating phone Barry and ask him to come and look at it.) We can use substitution to refer backwards or forwards. Forward substitution is far less common than backward substitution (The noun being referred to is underlined in the examples.): If you need them, there are nails in the toolbox (forward substitution). A large saucepan is what we need for making jam, but I don’t have one (backward substitution). We can use many different words and phrases in substitution, including words such as both, either, some (indefinite quantifying pronouns), do and so, and expressions such as the same and thus. The following words and phrases are commonly used as substitutes: There’s this card with a clown on it and this one with a monkey. Which do you think Mark would prefer? We use do, do so, do it, do the same to substitute for a verb and whatever accompanies it (complement): We do too. I can’t function without breakfast. (Do substitutes for have toast and coffee in the morning.) We can use so as a substitute in a number of ways: for an adjective (it remains so), an object clause (I think so), with reporting verbs (so I heard) and in exclamations (so he is!). We mostly use one and some/ones to substitute for countable nouns: She tried to get a ticket but she couldn’t get one. (She couldn’t get a ticket.) There are two second-hand ones at the end of the street on the right. Where there is nothing before or after ones, some or any are used as a plural substitute: Have either of you got any one pound coins for this machine? We can use indefinite quantifying pronouns such as (a) little, all, both, many, much, neither, few to substitute for noun phrases: Hundreds of people went to the village festival and all seemed to enjoy themselves very much. We can use that and those as substitutes meaning ‘the one(s)’ in more formal contexts: The water for the factory was that from the local reservoir. The books he read were those which he found in the old library. In formal contexts, especially in academic style, we use that of/those of: The head has a similar shape and size to that of a mammal. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

A speaker or writer can express certainty, possibility, willingness, obligation, necessity and ability by using modal words and expressions.

Here are the main verbs we use to express modal meanings: Core modal verbs: can, could, may, might, will, shall, would, should, must Other verbs with modal meanings: have (got) to, be going to and be able to There are a number of other words and expressions in English, apart from the main modal verbs, which also express modal meanings.

    "title": "Tags",
    "content": "Tags are either questions, statements or imperatives added to a clause to invite a response from the listener: Tags consist of one of the auxiliary verbs be, do or have, or the main verb be, or a modal verb, plus a subject, which is most commonly a pronoun: When we use auxiliary be, do or have, a modal verb or main verb be in the main clause, this verb is used in the tag: If there is no auxiliary or modal verb in the main clause, we use auxiliary do, does, did in the tag: If the main clause verb is I am, then the negative tag form is aren’t I: If the main clause verb is used to, the tag verb is did: If the main clause verb is ought to, the tag verb is most commonly should or, far less commonly, ought: We ought to leave now, really, shouldn’t we? Or (far less commonly) We ought to leave now, really, oughtn’t we? When tags follow imperatives, the tag verb is usually will: Question tags turn statements into yes-no questions. There are two types. The first type of question tag consists of an affirmative main clause and a negative tag, or a negative main clause and an affirmative tag. Negative tags are most commonly used in the contracted form: [main clause]She’s a translator, [tag]isn’t she? (affirmative main clause + negative tag) He hasn’t arrived yet, has he? (negative main clause + affirmative tag) We can use type 1 question tags when we expect the answer to the question to confirm that what we say in the main clause is true: You work with Barbara, don’t you? (A thinks it is true that B works with Barbara.) Sam’s not very old, is he? (A thinks it is true that Sam is not very old.) With type 1 tags, we can use falling intonation (↘) if we are fairly sure of the answer, and rising intonation (↗) if we are not so sure. The second type of question tag consists of an affirmative main clause and an affirmative tag: We can use type 2 tags when we do not know if the answer is yes or no. The intonation is usually a rising tone: Maureen lives in Hamden, does s↗he? (The speaker wants to know if Maureen lives in Hamden or not.) No, not actually a designer, but I work with graphics. A tag after an imperative clause softens the imperative a little. The tag verb is most commonly will but we can also use would, could, can and won’t: Don’t shout, will you? I can hear you perfectly well. After the imperative with let’s, we can use shall in the tag: We can use a statement tag to emphasise or reinforce an affirmative statement. The tag is also affirmative. They typically invite the listener to agree or sympathise in some way, or to offer a parallel comment. Statement tags are very informal: I’m bored with this, I am. (stronger than I’m bored with this) My Maths teacher was lovely. He was a great teacher, he was. When the main clause has a pronoun subject, a statement tag can have a noun as the subject instead of a pronoun: This construction is similar to a tail construction. We can use right and yeah in very informal situations instead of question tags: No, I’m too busy. Sorry. or (less informally) You’re not coming with us tonight, are you? Yeah. That’s what they said. or (less informally) They’ll be here about 4.30, won’t they/will they? made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "title": "Need",
    "content": "Need is a semi-modal verb because in some ways it is like a modal verb and in other ways like a main verb. We use need mostly in the negative form to indicate that there is no obligation or necessity to do something: Affirmatives with the semi-modal need are not common and they are used in formal contexts. There is almost always a negative word (e.g. no one, nobody, nothing) or phrase in the clause, even if the verb phrase is affirmative: No one need think that we are doing this every week. (we are not doing this every week) Nobody need know the name of the person who made the complaint. Need comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb): Not: No one need must read this. or No one must need read this. We form the negative by adding not after need. Need not can be contracted to needn’t. We don’t use don’t/doesn’t/didn’t with the semi-modal verb need: You need not spend a lot of money on presents. (formal) (or You needn’t spend a lot of money on presents.) Not: You don’t need spend a lot of money on presents. The question form of the semi-modal need is not very common. It is rather formal. The subject and need change position to form questions. We don’t use do/does/did. The semi-modal need is most common in the negative. We use it to show that there is no obligation: We needn’t spend much time on this topic. It’s not going to be in the exam. The semi-modal need has no past simple form. Instead, we use didn’t need to or didn’t have to when we express no obligation in the past: I didn’t need to buy any books. They were all in the library. (main verb need + to) (or I didn’t have to buy any books. They were all in the library.) Not: I didn’t need buy any books. They were all in the library. We use needn’t have + -ed form to refer to events which happened but which the speaker considers were unnecessary: You needn’t have waited for me. (You waited for me but it wasn’t necessary.) You needn’t have bought so much food. There are only three of us staying for the weekend. (You bought a lot of food but it wasn’t necessary.) We can use main verb need as an alternative to semi-modal need. Main verb need is followed by to and it changes with person, number and tense (I, you, we, they need to; she, he, it needs to; I, you, she, he, it, we, they needed to). In these examples, the meaning is the same for semi-modal need and main verb need + to. We must use the main verb need when it is followed by a noun phrase or -ing clause: My hair doesn’t need [-ing clause]cutting for at least another month. Not: My hair needn’t cutting for at least another month. The main verb need is followed by to when used with another verb. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "content": "We use used to when we refer to things in the past which are no longer true. It can refer to repeated actions or to a state or situation: He used to play football for the local team, but he’s too old now. That white house over there used to belong to my family. (It belonged to my family in the past, but not any more.) In statements, the form used to does not change. We do not use the verb be before it. It always refers to past time: We used to go to the seaside every summer when I was a kid. Not: We are used to go … or We use to go … or We were used to go … The negative of used to is most commonly didn’t use(d) to. Sometimes we write it with a final -d, sometimes not. Both forms are common, but many people consider the form with the final -d to be incorrect, and you should not use it in exams: It didn’t use to be so crowded in the shops as it is nowadays. I didn’t used to like broccoli when I was younger, but I love it now. (Don’t use this form in exams.) In very formal styles, we can use the negative form used not to: The most common form of question is auxiliary did + use(d) to. Many people consider the form with a final -d to be incorrect, and you should not use it in exams: I think we met once, a couple of years ago. Did you use to work with Kevin Harris? Didn’t she used to live in the same street as us? (Don’t use this form in written exams.) We can use the emphatic auxiliary did with used to: We never used to mix very much with the neighbours, but we did used to say hello to them in the street. (Don’t use this form in written exams.) We normally make tags after used to with auxiliary did: We can use used to or would to talk about people’s habits in the past. When we use them both together, used to most commonly comes first, as it sets the scene for the actions being reported: When we were kids, we used to invent amazing games. We would imagine we were the government and we would make crazy laws that everyone had to obey. Used to, but not would, can describe a state or situation which is no longer true: ‘The Townhouse’ used to be a Greek restaurant. It’s Italian now. Used to refers to actions and situations in the past which no longer happen or are no longer true. It always refers to the past: She used to sing in a choir, but she gave it up. (She sang, but she doesn’t sing any more) Be used to means ‘be accustomed to’ or ‘be familiar with’. It can refer to the past, present or future. We follow be used to with a noun phrase, a pronoun or the -ing form of a verb: I work in a hospital, so I’m used to long hours. (I am accustomed to/familiar with long hours.) She lives in a very small village and hates traffic. She’s not used to it. He was a salesman, so he was used to travelling up and down the country. (He was accustomed to/was familiar with travelling.) We can also say get used to or (more formally) become used to: University is very different from school, but don’t worry. You’ll soon get used to it. (or, more formally, You’ll soon become used to it.) made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "title": "Neither, neither … nor and not … either",
    "content": "Neither allows us to make a negative statement about two people or things at the same time. Neither goes before singular countable nouns. We use it to say ‘not either’ in relation to two things. Neither can be pronounced /ˈnaɪðə(r)/ or /ˈni:ðə(r)/. Neither parent came to meet the teacher. (The mother didn’t come and the father didn’t come.) Neither dress fitted her. (There were two dresses and not one of them fitted her.) We use neither of before pronouns and plural countable nouns which have a determiner (my, his, the) before them: In formal styles, we use neither of with a singular verb when it is the subject. However, in informal speaking, people often use plural verbs: Neither of them were interested in going to university. In speaking, we can use neither on its own in replies when we are referring to two things that have already been mentioned: We can use neither as a conjunction with nor. It connects two or more negative alternatives. This can sound formal in speaking: Neither Brian nor his wife mentioned anything about moving house. (Brian didn’t mention that they were moving house and his wife didn’t mention that they were moving house.) Neither Italy nor France got to the quarter finals last year. The less formal alternative is to use and … not … either: Italy didn’t get to the quarter finals last year and France didn’t either. When a clause with neither or nor is used after a negative clause, we invert the subject and the verb after neither and nor: He hadn’t done any homework, neither had he brought any of his books to class. We didn’t get to see the castle, nor did we see the cathedral. We use neither and nor + auxiliary/modal verb + subject to mean ‘also not’: I hate snakes. I can’t even look at a picture of a snake. We can use not … either to mean ‘also not’, but we do not change the word order of the auxiliary or modal verb and subject: We use neither, not none, when we are talking about two people or things: Books and television are different. Neither of them should replace the other. We don’t normally use both (of) + not to make a negative statement about two people or things: Take care to spell neither correctly: not ‘niether’ or ‘neighter’. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "source": "Cambridge Grammar",
    "title": "Not",
    "content": "Not is one of the most common words we use to indicate negation. It is often shortened to n’t and joined to an auxiliary verb or modal verb: We form negative declarative clauses with not after be (she is not talking), after modal verbs (they must not go) and after auxiliary verbs do and have (we did not like it; they have not eaten). In informal situations, we add n’t to be, modal verbs and auxiliary verbs do and have. There is no space between the verb and n’t: Although he doesn’t know much Chinese, he is fluent in French, German, and Italian. Not: I amn’t allowed to … (amn’t is common in Irish and Scots English, however.) With is and are there are two possible negative statements, ’s not or isn’t and ’re not or aren’t. The forms ’s not and ’re not are more common after pronouns; isn’t and aren’t are more common after noun phrases: The girls aren’t here yet. They’re not coming until later. The programme isn’t ready. It’s not printed yet. (or The programme’s not ready yet.) In questions and question tags we use aren’t with I: We use the full form not for more formal writing or for emphasis: The Lady Jinneth went out riding alone this afternoon, and she has not yet come back. Couldn’t he pay someone to help him with the garden? When there is no modal verb or auxiliary verb or be, we use auxiliary verb do + n’t or do + not (don’t, do not, doesn’t, does not, didn’t, did not): Questions with not instead of n’t sound more formal or give more emphasis. We put not after the subject. We use don’t + the base form of the verb or do + not + the base form of the verb to make negative imperatives. We use these to give orders, instructions or commands. Do not is stronger and much more formal: Do not turn off your computer without shutting down properly. We use don’t + you in informal speaking to make the order stronger: We’re getting divorced. Don’t you dare tell anyone! We can use don’t let’s or let’s not for first person plural imperatives (us) to make suggestions: We can use the short form don’t as an imperative answer or reaction to something: No, don’t. She’s too tired. (No, don’t ask Mum to help us.) We use not in negative short replies with mental process verbs (e.g. be afraid, guess, hope): With think, we usually use I don’t think so rather than I think not, which is much more formal and rare: In short replies to yes-no questions, we use not after adverbs like probably, maybe, certainly to express degrees of certainty: Do you think she’ll remember to come at five instead of six? We often use not after but to express a contrast. We often leave out the verb phrase or part of it in the second clause: You can look but not touch. (You can look but you can’t touch.) Write the instructions in capitals but not in bold. (Write the instructions in capitals but don’t write them in bold.) There were a few problems but not too many. (There were a few problems but there weren’t too many problems.) We use not before an -ing clause in more formal styles: Not knowing what to say, she started to walk towards the door. Not being heard or listened to is something that elderly people can find frightening. She didn’t want to admit to not knowing what the Emerald Isle was. (‘The Emerald Isle’ is another name for Ireland.) We use not to negate a to-infinitive clause. We can use not before or after to, but some people consider ‘split infinitives’ (when not comes between to and the verb) to be incorrect: … she wanted to stay for a long time, to not think, to not be afraid, to not be so, so lonely. We can use or not in questions to ask about a range of possibilities: We sometimes use it to force someone to make a decision: Are you going to apologise to me or not? (Are you going to apologise to me or are you not going to apologise to me?) We often use or not after if or whether to express a contrast in expectation: He always spoke the truth whether it was popular or not. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

We use singular verbs with singular nouns, and plural verbs with plural nouns: The rules for making the plural of nouns depend on the spelling and pronunciation. Most nouns form their plural by adding -s: In other cases, the plural depends on how the noun ends. If the noun ends in -ch, -s, -sh, -x or -z, add -es. The plural ending -es. is pronounced /ɪz/ (/ˈbɒksɪz/, /ˈwɒtʃɪz/). If the noun ends in a consonant plus -y, change y to i and add -es. For some nouns ending in -f, change -f to -ves but note: roof-roofs, belief-beliefs, cliff-cliffs. Some nouns which come from Latin and Greek form their plurals in special ways.

    "content": "Some nouns consist of more than one word. These are compound nouns. Compound nouns can be formed in different ways. The most common way is to put two nouns together (noun + noun); other common types are adjective + noun and verb + noun. Many compound nouns are written as one word, but some are written with hyphens or spaces. In modern English, hyphens are less common than they were in the past. A good learner’s dictionary will tell you how each compound is usually written. We form the plural of most compounds by adding a plural ending to the last part of the compound: We saw some large greenhouses with vegetables growing in them. The compounds mother-in-law, brother-in-law, etc. form their plurals on the first noun: I’ve got one brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law. Compound nouns normally have the spoken stress on the first part: CAR park, BATHroom, WEBsite, BROther-in-law, DOORbell, CHECK-in However, not all compound nouns follow this rule. Some have spoken stress on the second part, especially in proper names and titles: A good learner’s dictionary will tell you where to put the stress. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

They cannot be used with numbers. They include the names of certain tools, instruments and articles of clothing which have two parts.

I’ll have to go upstairs and change. She spent all her savings on a trip to South America. Some nouns refer to groups of people (e.g. audience, committee, government, team). These are sometimes called collective nouns. Some collective nouns can take a singular or plural verb, depending on whether they are considered as a single unit or as a collection of individuals: The audience was larger than average and the concert was a success. The government is hoping that online voting will attract more young people to vote. The government are all very nervous about the report, which will be published tomorrow.

In regular one-syllable verbs with a single vowel followed by a consonant, we double the final consonant when adding -ed to make the past simple: For regular verbs, there are three possible pronunciations of -ed endings. after all vowel sounds and after voiced consonants (except /d/) after all voiceless consonants (except /t/)/k/ /p/ /f/ /s/ /ʃ/ /tʃ/ cried, tried, hurried, weighed, smiled, planned, judged, sneezed, lived Many verbs are irregular. Here are some common ones. Each one has to be learnt. The verb form is the same for all persons (I, you, she, he, it, we, they), and we make questions and negatives with irregular verbs in the same ways as for regular verbs. I wrote him an email to explain why I couldn’t meet him. We use the past simple to talk about definite time in the past (often we specify when something happened, e.g. yesterday, three weeks ago, last year, when I was young): We use the past simple to talk about single or regular (habitual) events or states in the past. He fell off his bike and his friends took him to a doctor. They travelled to Italy every summer and always stayed in small villages on the coast. As children, we played all kinds of games on the street. When we use the past simple to refer to habitual events, the meaning is similar to used to: I did a lot of travelling when I was younger. (or I used to do a lot of travelling when I was younger.) Sometimes there is no time expression when the past simple is used. This happens especially when we know the time: Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. (From our general knowledge, we know that Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa a few hundred years ago.) Do you know Grace? She was in my class at primary school. Do you know Grace? She was in my class at primary school in the 70s. Past simple without a definite time reference: both speakers know when this time was and do not need to say it. They know each other well. Past simple with a definite time reference: the speaker is not sure if the listener knows when she was at primary school. When one past event happens after another, the first one mentioned in the past simple happened first and the second one happened next, and so on. If we change the order of the verbs, this changes the meaning. [event 1]I turned off the light and [event 2]got into bed. The first event in the past simple happened first. The second event in the past simple happened second, and so on.

    "content": "There are a number of spelling rules for when we make the -ing form of the verb. We generally use the past continuous to talk about actions and states in progress (happening) around a particular time in the past. It can emphasise that the action or state continued for a period of time in the past: I’m not sure. I think she was visiting her family. (action) I remember that night. You were wearing that red dress. (state) When one event is more important than another in the past, we can use the past continuous for the background event (the less important event) and the past simple for the main event: [background event]Lisa was cycling to school when [main event]she saw the accident. [background event]What were you thinking about when [main event]you won the race? We often use the past continuous to give a reason or context for an event: It was funny. They were staying in the hotel next to ours. (giving a reason/context for meeting them) I didn’t make the meeting last week; I was travelling to Rome. We can use the past continuous to talk about repeated background events in the past. It can suggest that the situation was temporary or subject to change: She was feeding her neighbours’ cat every morning while they were on holiday. Then one morning, it was gone. The neighbours were making so much noise, night after night. We had to complain eventually. We only use the past continuous for repeated background events. If they are repeated main events, we use the past simple: I phoned you four times last night. Where were you? We don’t use the past continuous in the same way as used to when we talk about things in the past which are no longer true: We used to go on holiday to Yorkshire every year when I was little. Adverbs such as always, constantly, forever are used with the past continuous when we talk about repeated, unplanned or undesired events: We were always spending so much time in traffic. That’s the main reason why we decided to move to the country and work from home. My boss was constantly phoning me in my last job. I hated it. We sometimes use the past continuous to refer to a definite period of past time. This usually emphasises the event continuing over a period of time: We were cooking all morning because we had 15 people coming for lunch. Lots of us were working at the office on Saturday because we had to finish the project by Monday. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

Whether we choose to use the past continuous or past simple often depends on how we see the past event(s). Doctors were treating patients in temporary beds and they were trying to do their best in a difficult situation. Past continuous: writer chooses to show the events as ongoing at that time in the past. Doctors treated patients in temporary beds and they tried to do their best in a difficult situation. Past simple: writer chooses to show the events as finished. We use the past continuous to talk about events and temporary states that were in progress around a certain time in the past. We use the past simple to talk about events, states or habits at definite times in the past. The past continuous emphasises the action or event in progress around a time in the past. The event (working) was in progress at 4 pm. At 4 pm last Monday, I finished work early and went home. The past simple emphasises the event that happened at a definite time in the past. The focus is not on events in progress but rather on the whole events (finished work, went home). When one event is more important than the other in the past, we can use the past simple to emphasise the main event.

We commonly use the past perfect in reported clauses where the reporting verb (underlined) is in the past: The policeman said Mr Hammond had driven through a red light. I phoned Katie and she said the kids had had a day off school so she’d taken them ice skating. We also use the past perfect when the reporting verb is a verb of perception and is in the past tense: My Dad was really angry because he heard I hadn’t come home until 3 am! I saw she’d bought the DVD so I asked if I could borrow it. The doctor felt my mother had got worse since last week. We often use the past perfect to refer to situations which have changed. In speaking, had is often stressed: I had planned to go to the beach but look at the rain! (had is stressed; the meaning is ‘I have now changed my mind’) I’m very happy working as an engineer but I had wanted to be an actor when I was younger. We must use the past perfect when we imagine a different past in a clause with if: I would have helped to paint the house if you’d asked me. (You didn’t ask me.) Sarah couldn’t come with us to the cinema. She would have loved it if she had been there. (She wasn’t there.) We don’t use the past perfect in the main clause of a conditional sentence.

We write them as one word: All your clothes are clean. I washed everything yesterday. The sand got everywhere, into eyes, hair, tents, cups of tea, camera lenses. We use everyone, everybody, everything and everywhere with singular verbs: At night, with the lights shining on the water, everything looks different. When we want to refer back to everyone or everybody and we don’t know if everyone is male or female, we use him or her and his or her. In informal styles, we use plural pronouns they, their and them: Everybody has a team leader in charge of him or her. Everyone has to climb to the top. When they get to the top, they have to blow their whistle. (more informal) We can use everybody and everyone as the subject of imperative clauses. We use the base form of the verb: Everyone and everybody mean the same. Everyone is a little more formal than everybody. Everyone is used more in writing than everybody: When everyone had gathered in the garden, Sergeant joined them and said, ‘Welcome, everyone!’ Twenty years ago everyone used an alarm clock that rang like a bell.

    "content": "We commonly use the pronoun it as both a subject and an object pronoun: Has anyone seen my phone? I can’t find it anywhere. That furniture is lovely. It isn’t too expensive for us, is it? You know the flat with three bedrooms by the supermarket? It’s the best one we’ve seen so far, isn’t it? We can use it as an ‘empty’ subject or as an ‘empty’ object. It is ‘empty’ because it doesn’t refer to anything in particular: It’s getting a bit late now, so let’s watch a DVD at home, shall we? We also use it to introduce or ‘anticipate’ the subject or object of a sentence, especially when the subject or object of the sentence is a clause. Most commonly, such clauses are to + infinitive and that clauses. We also call this use of it a ‘dummy’ subject, since the real subject is another part of the sentence (real subject underlined): It’s good that she’s doing more exercise. (or, more formally: That she’s doing more exercise is good.) It was nice to talk with them again. (or, more formally: To talk with them again was nice.) It’s quite likely that we shall be late, so please do start without us. With verbs such as find or consider, it + adjective + that clause or it + adjective + to infinitive, are commonly used to anticipate an object: I find it amazing that they’ve never stopped arguing about football. I must say, local people will consider it to be an insult that they have not learned to speak a few words of the language. We also use it when a clause is the subject of a verb such as appear, seem, look, occur, which hedge or soften the statement, making it less direct: It seems they’ve all lost contact since they met at the wedding. It occurred to me that we might visit them while we are in South Africa. We use it in cleft sentences. It emphasises the subject or object of the main clause: It was his sister who ran the marathon in New York, wasn’t it? It is common with the passive voice. It makes the sentence seem less personal and more objective: It was decided that we should all swim across the lake before breakfast.

Some people may consider such words to be dated. More commonly, words such as actor are used to refer to both male and female. Some nouns which used to end in -man are now neutral and are used to include both genders: flight attendant (preferred to steward and stewardess) The title Ms is preferred to Mrs (married woman) or Miss (unmarried woman) so that we cannot tell whether the woman is married or not.

    "source": "Cambridge Grammar",
    "title": "Pronouns: personal (I, me, you, him, it, they, etc.)",
    "content": "We use personal pronouns in place of noun phrases. We often use them to refer back to people and things that we have already identified (underlined): Peter complained to the chef about the meal. She wasn’t very helpful so he spoke to the manager. (she = the chef, he = Peter) Personal pronouns show person and number. He, she, him and her show gender. They have different subject and object forms (except you, it and one which have only one form): Personal subject pronouns act as the subject of a clause. We use them before a verb to show who is doing the verb. We do not usually leave out the pronoun: We use personal object pronouns in all other positions, such as after the verb or after a preposition: Paula’s coming to visit us in September. (us = object) Thanks again for everything you did for me. (for me = prepositional phrase) We also use personal object pronouns as complements of the verb be: That’s him. That’s the man I was talking about. (him = complement of be) We can use some object pronouns (me, him, her, us and them) as short answers, particularly in informal speaking: We use I and me to refer to the speaker or writer. I is the subject form and me is the object form: It’s me. Can you open the door? I haven’t got my key. (It is I. is not often used. It is very formal.) We sometimes hear me used as a subject in informal speaking after another subject + and: My friends and me went on holiday to a little town on the south coast. (or Me and my friends went on holiday …; My friends and I went … is considered to be more correct.) We sometimes use us to refer to me in informal speaking: We use you to refer to the listener or reader. It is both the subject and the object form. You can refer to one person or more than one person. It is usually clear from the context whether you is singular or plural: Paul, do you need any help? (refers to one person, Paul) The match starts at 10.30. I need you to be here at 10. (refers to a group of people) We sometimes use you all to address everyone in a group: In informal contexts, we also use you to refer to people in general, not someone specific: You get a pension if you’re a man over the age of 65 or a woman over 60. He, him, she and her are singular third person pronouns. He and him are the masculine forms. She and her are the feminine forms: Yes I saw him in town last week. He’s looking really well. Traditionally, he and him were used to refer to both genders in formal writing: If anyone has any evidence to oppose this view, let him inform the police immediately. Nowadays, we often see gender neutral forms (e.g. he or she, he/she, s/he, (s)he, they and him or her, him/her, them) when we do not know if the person referred to is male or female: The bank manager could help with your problem. He or she will probably be able to give you a loan. (or … he/she will probably be able to … or … they will probably be able to …) Go to a hairdresser. Ask him or her to come up with a style that suits you, your hair, your lifestyle. (or … ask him/her to come up with a style … or … ask them to come up with a style …) When you get into the building, go to the person on the desk in the reception area. They can tell you where to go. (or He or she can tell you where to go.) My computer isn’t working. It’s crashed again. Can you have a look at it? We use it as an empty pronoun, also known as a ‘dummy’ subject, where there is no other subject to put in the subject position, particularly when referring to the weather or time: We usually use it to refer to countries, vehicles and machines. In some traditional styles, she was sometimes used, but this is now considered inappropriate by many people: We spent three weeks in Malaysia. It’s a beautiful country. Three hours after the ship sailed, it developed engine trouble. (or, more traditionally: … she developed engine trouble.) We use we and us to refer to different groups of people, but always including the speaker. We and us can refer to the speaker + the listener, or the speaker + other people but not the listener, or people in general including the speaker: We could go and see a film tonight. What do you think? (we = speaker + listener) Gerald asked us if we’d drive to London and get you. (us/we = speaker + others but not listener you) Changing diet, rather than dieting, is a healthier alternative. There are changes we should all make. (we = speaker + listener + all other people) We use they and them to refer to specific groups of people, things and animals: The kids are getting on my nerves. They’re making so much noise. Can you tell them to be quiet? I’m trying to work. Have you seen my keys? I never remember where I’ve left them. We also use they and them to refer to institutions or authorities, and groups of people in general: I heard they’re going to publish a new edition of ‘War and Peace’. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

(or The director of the company himself wrote to us to apologise for the dreadful service.) We don’t use reflexive pronouns on their own as the subject of a clause, but we can use them with a noun or pronoun to emphasise the subject: Parents and teachers always pass on to children what they themselves have been told, and this has been going on for hundreds, or even thousands of years.

    "content": "Intonation describes how the voice rises and falls in speech. The three main patterns of intonation in English are: falling intonation, rising intonation and fall-rise intonation. Falling intonation describes how the voice falls on the final stressed syllable of a phrase or a group of words. A falling intonation is very common in wh-questions. We also use falling intonation when we say something definite, or when we want to be very clear about something: Rising intonation describes how the voice rises at the end of a sentence. Rising intonation is common in yes-no questions: I hear the Health Centre is expanding. So, is that the new d↗octor? Fall-rise intonation describes how the voice falls and then rises. We use fall-rise intonation at the end of statements when we want to say that we are not sure, or when we may have more to add: I do↘n’t support any football team at the m↘om↗ent. (but I may change my mind in future). It rained every day in the firs↘t w↗eek. (but things improved after that). We use fall-rise intonation with questions, especially when we request information or invite somebody to do or to have something. The intonation pattern makes the questions sound more polite: made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

The second question is more specific. Could I have a lift with you if you are driving to college? The first question is introductory. A knows that B usually drives to college. The second question is more specific. By asking the question in two stages, the speaker is being less direct with the listener. A asks B for a lift to college all in one question. This is correct too, but it is slightly more direct. Sometimes we ask if we can ask a question. This is very polite: In formal contexts, such as interviews, we commonly use these polite pre-questions before we ask the main question: May I ask you a question about your last job?

    "title": "Questions: wh-questions",
    "content": "Wh-questions begin with what, when, where, who, whom, which, whose, why and how. We use them to ask for information. The answer cannot be yes or no: We usually form wh-questions with wh- + an auxiliary verb (be, do or have) + subject + main verb or with wh- + a modal verb + subject + main verb: When what, who, which or whose is the subject or part of the subject, we do not use the auxiliary. We use the word order subject + verb: Who is the subject of the sentence and this bag is the object. We use no auxiliary verb. Who is the object of the sentence and you is the subject. We use the auxiliary verb do. Wh-questions ask for information and we do not expect a yes-no answer to a wh-question. We expect an answer which gives information: Where’s the coffee machine? (We expect an answer about the location of the coffee machine.) How old is your dog? (We expect an answer about the age of the dog.) We can add emphasis to wh-questions in speaking by stressing the auxiliary verb do. We usually do this when we have not already received the information that we expected from an earlier question, or to show strong interest. When the wh-word is the object of the sentence, the do auxiliary is stressed to make it more emphatic: When the wh-word is the subject of the sentence, we can add the auxiliary do to make it emphatic. We stress do: So who does live there? (non-emphatic question: So who lives there?) When we ask negative wh-questions, we use the auxiliary verb do when there is no other auxiliary or modal verb, even when the wh-word is the subject of the clause: In speaking, we can sometimes turn wh-questions into statement questions: We do this especially when we are checking information that we have already been given or when we want to quickly check a particular detail. These are less formal than full wh-questions: You’re travelling with who? (more formal: Who are you travelling with?) And she’s here until when? (more formal: And when is she here until? or even more formal: Until when is she here?) The intonation of wh-questions is normally falling. The falling intonation is on the most important syllable: When we ask wh-questions to check or clarify information that has already been given, we may use rising or fall-rising intonation: Wh↗at did you say the time was? (I know you’ve told me before but I’ve forgotten.) We can use wh-words and phrases after prepositions in more formal questions: In informal styles, especially in speaking, the preposition may be separated and placed at the end of the question clause: To whom should we send the invitation? (more formal) For what reason did she leave him? (formal: preposition + wh-phrase) When we make questions shorter, we usually put the preposition and its complement together: When we ask questions using verbs consisting of a main verb + particle, e.g. get up, set out (phrasal verbs), we do not separate the verb from the particle or preposition: made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

In speaking, a second speaker often uses a which-clause like this to evaluate or give an opinion on something the first speaker has said: [The speakers are talking about trains. Paddington is a train station in London.] So it leaves Paddington at 8.30 and it’ll get me into Gloucester at 10.15. Which is perfect because I can pick you up on my way home. (Speaker B is evaluating the fact that the train gets into Gloucester at 10.15.) Sometimes the same speaker may add a which-clause after a response by a listener: I was already working with them doing a temporary job and I was asked if I would go on a permanent contract. Which I did. (Speaker A was offered a permanent job contract and accepted the offer.)

    "title": "Relative clauses: defining and non-defining",
    "content": "We use defining relative clauses to give essential information about someone or something – information that we need in order to understand what or who is being referred to. A defining relative clause usually comes immediately after the noun it describes. We usually use a relative pronoun (e.g. who, that, which, whose and whom) to introduce a defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in bold, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.): They should give the money to somebody who they think needs the treatment most. She’s now playing a woman whose son was killed in the First World War. In defining relative clauses we often use that instead of who, whom or which. This is very common in informal speaking: The relative pronoun can define the subject or the object of the verb: They’re the people who/that bought our house. (The people bought our house. The people is the subject.) They’re the people who/that she met at Jon’s party. (She met the people. The people is the object.) Here are some cells which/that show abnormality. (Some cells show abnormality. Some cells is the subject.) Here are some cells which/that the researcher has identified. (The researcher has identified some cells. Some cells is the object.) We often leave out the relative pronoun when it is the object of the verb: In writing, we don’t use commas in defining relative clauses: This is a man who takes his responsibilities seriously. Not: This is a man, who takes his responsibilities seriously. When the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the subject (underlined) is the same: She’s the lady who lent me her phone. (who is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun she) There are now only two schools in the area that actually teach Latin. (that is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun they) Not: There are now only two schools in the area that they actually teach Latin. When the relative pronoun is the object of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the object (underlined) is the same: We had a lovely meal at the place which Phil recommended. (which is the object of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun it) Not: We had a lovely meal at the place which Phil recommended it. We use non-defining relative clauses to give extra information about the person or thing. It is not necessary information. We don’t need it to understand who or what is being referred to. We always use a relative pronoun (who, which, whose or whom) to introduce a non-defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in bold, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.) Clare, who I work with, is doing the London marathon this year. Not: Clare, I work with, is doing the London marathon this year. Doctors use the testing kit for regular screening for lung and stomach cancers, which account for 70% of cancers treated in the western world. Alice, who has worked in Brussels and London ever since leaving Edinburgh, will be starting a teaching course in the autumn. We don’t use that to introduce a non-defining relative clause: Allen, who scored three goals in the first game, was the only player to perform well. Not: Allen, that scored three goals in the first game, was the only player to perform well. In writing, we use commas around non-defining relative clauses: Etheridge, who is English-born with Irish parents, replaces Neil Francis, whose injury forced him to withdraw last week. In speaking, we often pause at the beginning and end of the clause: Unlike American firms – which typically supply all three big American car makers – Japanese ones traditionally work exclusively with one maker. (formal) And this woman – who I’d never met before – came up and spoke to me. (informal) Sometimes defining and non-defining relative clauses can look very similar but have different meanings. His brother, who works at the supermarket, is a friend of mine. He has only one brother, and that brother works at the supermarket. His brother who works at the supermarket is a friend of mine. He has more than one brother. The one I’m talking about works at the supermarket. It’s hoped that we will raise £10,000 for local charities, which help the homeless. The money is intended for local charities. All these local charities help the homeless. It’s hoped that we will raise £10,000 for local charities which help the homeless. The money is intended for local charities. Some of these local charities help the homeless. There are other local charities as well as these. The information in a defining relative clause is essential, so we can’t leave out the relative clause. The information in a non-defining relative clause is extra information which isn’t essential, so we can leave out the relative clause. The soldier who had gold stripes on his uniform seemed to be the most important one. A defining relative clause which we can’t leave out; without this information we do not know which soldier the speaker is referring to. The tour party was weakened when Gordon Hamilton, who played in the World Cup team, withdrew yesterday because of a back injury, which kept him out of the Five Nations Championship. Non-defining relative clauses which we can leave out: The tour party was weakened when Gordon Hamilton withdrew yesterday because of a back injury. We can use that instead of who, whom or which in defining relative clauses, but not in non-defining relative clauses: I think anyone who speaks in public is nervous beforehand. I think anyone that speaks in public is nervous beforehand. Her car, which was very old, broke down after just five miles. Not: Her car, that was very old, broke down after just five miles. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "title": "Reported speech: direct speech",
    "content": "Direct speech is a representation of the actual words someone said. A direct speech report usually has a reporting verb in the past simple. The most common reporting verb is said. The reporting clause may come first or second. The reporting clause may sometimes come in the middle of the reported clause, especially in literary styles: ‘Was it,’ he asked, ‘the first time you had spoken to Mrs Dalton?’ We can use adverbs with the reporting verb to describe the way someone said something. This is more common when the reporting clause comes second: ‘Can I speak to the doctor?’ she asked rather nervously. In narratives, especially novels and short stories, when the reporting clause comes second, we often invert the subject (s) and reporting verb (v): “Things have always been the same in this village,” [V]said [S]the old man. In informal conversation, we sometimes use the present simple in the reporting clause. This makes the direct speech more vivid and dramatic: So then this guy says, “I’ve got something for you. Come over here.” And he picked up a box and he says, “Open that.” We can make the direct speech even more vivid and dramatic by using the present continuous. This is very informal: And he’s looking at me and he’s asking, “Who are you?” and I said, “I’m your nephew” and he’s mumbling, “I don’t know you. I’ve never seen you before in my life.” In very informal conversation, people sometimes use says as a reporting verb for all persons (I, you, she, he, we, they): She says, ‘What’s going on here?’ and I says, ‘Nothing. There’s nothing happening – everything’s okay.’ Many speakers consider the above examples to be incorrect. This applies especially to the use of says with all persons. We also use the present simple in newspaper headlines. This makes the reported words more dramatic: made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

    "source": "Cambridge Grammar",
    "title": "Reported speech: indirect speech",
    "content": "Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words. In indirect speech, the structure of the reported clause depends on whether the speaker is reporting a statement, a question or a command. Indirect reports of statements consist of a reporting clause and a that-clause. We often omit that, especially in informal situations: The pilot commented that the weather had been extremely bad as the plane came in to land. (The pilot’s words were: ‘The weather was extremely bad as the plane came in to land.’) I told my wife I didn’t want a party on my 50th birthday. (that-clause without that) (or I told my wife that I didn’t want a party on my 50th birthday.) Indirect reports of yes-no questions and questions with or consist of a reporting clause and a reported clause introduced by if or whether. If is more common than whether. The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form: She asked if [S] [V]I was Scottish. (original yes-no question: ‘Are you Scottish?’) The waiter asked whether [S]we [V]wanted a table near the window. (original yes-no question: ‘Do you want a table near the window?) He asked me if [S] [V]I had come by train or by bus. (original alternative question: ‘Did you come by train or by bus?’) Questions: yes-no questions (Are you feeling cold?) Indirect reports of wh-questions consist of a reporting clause, and a reported clause beginning with a wh-word (who, what, when, where, why, how). We don’t use a question mark: The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form: She wanted to know who [S]we [V]had invited to the party. In indirect questions with who, whom and what, the wh-word may be the subject or the object of the reported clause: I asked them who came to meet them at the airport. (who is the subject of came; original question: ‘Who came to meet you at the airport?’) He wondered what the repairs would cost. (what is the object of cost; original question: ‘What will the repairs cost?’) The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form: She asked us what [S]we [V]were doing. (original question: ‘What are you doing?’) We also use statement word order (subject + verb) with when, where, why and how: I asked her when [S]it [V]had happened (original question: ‘When did it happen?’). I asked her where [S]the bus station [V]was. (original question: ‘Where is the bus station?’) The teacher asked them how [S]they [V]wanted to do the activity. (original question: ‘How do you want to do the activity?’) Not: The teacher asked them how did they want to do the activity? Indirect reports of commands consist of a reporting clause, and a reported clause beginning with a to-infinitive: The General ordered the troops to advance. (original command: ‘Advance!’) The chairperson told him to sit down and to stop interrupting. (original command: ‘Sit down and stop interrupting!’) We also use a to-infinitive clause in indirect reports with other verbs that mean wanting or getting people to do something, for example, advise, encourage, warn: They advised me to wait till the following day. (original statement: ‘You should wait till the following day.’) The guard warned us not to enter the area. (original statement: ‘You must not enter the area.’) We can use the reporting verb in the present simple in indirect speech if the original words are still true or relevant at the time of reporting, or if the report is of something someone often says or repeats: Sheila says they’re closing the motorway tomorrow for repairs. Henry tells me he’s thinking of getting married next year. Rupert says dogs shouldn’t be allowed on the beach. (Rupert probably often repeats this statement.) We often use the present simple in newspaper headlines. It makes the reported speech more dramatic: PRIME MINISTER SAYS FAMILIES ARE TOP PRIORITY IN TAX REFORM In indirect speech, we can use the past continuous form of the reporting verb (usually say or tell). This happens mostly in conversation, when the speaker wants to focus on the content of the report, usually because it is interesting news or important information, or because it is a new topic in the conversation: Rory was telling me the big cinema in James Street is going to close down. Is that true? Alex was saying that book sales have gone up a lot this year thanks to the Internet. ‘Backshift’ refers to the changes we make to the original verbs in indirect speech because time has passed between the moment of speaking and the time of the report. In these examples, the present (am) has become the past (was), the future (will) has become the future-in-the-past (would) and the past (happened) has become the past perfect (had happened). The tenses have ‘shifted’ or ‘moved back’ in time. The past perfect does not shift back; it stays the same: Some, but not all, modal verbs ‘shift back’ in time and change in indirect speech. ‘It must be awful to live in such a noisy place,’ she said. She said it must be awful to live in such a noisy place. We can use a perfect form with have + -ed form after modal verbs, especially where the report looks back to a hypothetical event in the past: He said the noise might have been the postman delivering letters. (original statement: ‘The noise might be the postman delivering letters.’) He said he would have helped us if we’d needed a volunteer. (original statement: ‘I’ll help you if you need a volunteer’ or ‘I’d help you if you needed a volunteer.’) Used to and ought to do not change in indirect speech: She said she used to live in Oxford. (original statement: ‘I used to live in Oxford.’) The guard warned us that we ought to leave immediately. (original statement: ‘You ought to leave immediately.’) We don’t need to change the tense in indirect speech if what a person said is still true or relevant or has not happened yet. This often happens when someone talks about the future, or when someone uses the present simple, present continuous or present perfect in their original words: He told me his brother works for an Italian company. (It is still true that his brother works for an Italian company.) She said she’s getting married next year. (For the speakers, the time at the moment of speaking is ‘this year’.) He said he’s finished painting the door. (He probably said it just a short time ago.) She promised she’ll help us. (The promise applies to the future.) Changes to personal pronouns in indirect reports depend on whether the person reporting the speech and the person(s) who said the original words are the same or different. ‘You need to be here at nine o’clock,’ George told Beatrice. George told Beatrice she needed to be there at nine o’clock. ‘I hope you will join us tonight,’ I said to James. We often change demonstratives (this, that) and adverbs of time and place (now, here, today, etc.) because indirect speech happens at a later time than the original speech, and perhaps in a different place. I told her I would meet her there the next/following day. She said, ‘I do not wish to discuss it at this moment in time.’ She said she did not wish to discuss it at that moment in time. ‘I finished the job three weeks ago,’ the boy protested. The boy protested that he had finished the job three weeks before. The word order in indirect reports of wh-questions is the same as statement word order (subject + verb), not question word order: We don’t use a question mark when reporting wh-questions: made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.

(active) This book was published by Cambridge University Press. (passive) The active voice is the typical word order. We put the subject (the topic or the theme) first. The subject is the ‘doer’ or agent of the verb: Edward Barnes designed these houses in the 1880s. (active) In the passive, the person or thing that the action was done to becomes the topic or theme. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’): These houses were designed in the 1880s. (passive without agent) These houses were designed in the 1880s by Edward Barnes. (passive + by + agent) We use the passive when we want to change the focus of a clause, or if the doer of the verb is not important or not known or if we do not want to say who the doer is. made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches Stock market turmoil (Talking about stock markets and share prices) To add ${headword} to a word list please sign up or log in.
